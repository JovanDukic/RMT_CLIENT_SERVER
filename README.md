# RMT_CLIENT_SERVER
This repository contains two java projects.<br />
MySQL is required to run both projects.<br />

<Setting up Server project>
In MySQL Workbench set up a new connection with the following parameter values:<br />  
1. hostname: localhost <br />
2. port number: 3306 <br />  
<br />
In order to connect to MySQL Server click on previously made connection and enter your password.<br /> 
The same username and password needs to be inside Config class (eighth and nineth row).<br /><br />
  
**IF YOUR SERVER FOLDER CONTAINS *ServerStatus* FILE YOU NEED TO DELETE IT.**
  
<Setting up Client project>
Since program is made using JavaFX software platform it requires JavaFX SDK.<br /><br />
